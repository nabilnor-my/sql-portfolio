# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository contains my SQL projects, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, aggregation, window functions, CTEs, and BigQuery.

## ðŸ—‚ Projects Overview

Each project is organized in its own folder with:
- `queries.sql` â€” the SQL scripts
- `results.csv` â€” exported query results
- `README.md` â€” explanation of the project

### 1. Birth Data Analysis
- **Folder**: [`01_birth_data_analysis`](01_birth_data_analysis)
- **Dataset**: `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
- **Description**: Explores average birth weights, counts, and trends per year and state.  
- **Skills**: Aggregations, CTEs, window functions, filtering, ranking.

## ðŸ’¡ Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Filtering (`WHERE`, `HAVING`, `BETWEEN`)
- Window Functions (`LAG`, `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
- CTEs (`WITH` clauses)
- Data cleaning and handling nulls

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use
1. Navigate into any project folder.  
2. Open `queries.sql` to see the SQL scripts.  
3. Optionally, check `results.csv` to see the query outputs.  
4. Each project folder has its own README explaining the queries and insights.

## ðŸ”— Tools
- BigQuery (Google Cloud)  
- SQL (Standard SQL)

# Project 2: Sales Analysis

This project explores the **TheLook E-Commerce dataset** using SQL to analyze sales performance, buyer behavior, and market insights.

## Task Folders

1. [Sales Performance Review](01_sales_performance_review):  
   Queries to analyze monthly revenue trends and calculate **month-over-month (MoM) growth** using aggregations, window functions (`LAG()`), and growth rate calculations.

2. [US Market Insights](02_us_market_insights):  
   Queries to analyze **state-level sales performance** in the US, covering **user demographics, buyer behavior (one-time vs repeat)**, and **revenue breakdowns** by segment using joins, conditional aggregation, and cohort segmentation.

# Task 3.1: Customer Lifetime Value by Gender

## ðŸ“Œ Goal
The goal of this task is to calculate and compare **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** across gender segments.  
This provides insight into whether **male or female customers** generate higher long-term value for the business.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**:  
  - `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`  
  - `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items`  
  - `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users`  
- **Description**: Dataset includes order transactions, purchased items, and user demographics, restricted to **U.S. customers with completed orders**.

## ðŸ’» Queries Overview

### 1. Data Preparation
- Joined **orders**, **order items**, and **users**.  
- Filtered only for **completed U.S. orders**.  

### 2. User-Level Metrics
For each customer:
- **Revenue** = `SUM(sale_price)`  
- **Order Count** = `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`  
- **Lifespan** = `MAX(order_date) - MIN(order_date)` in months  

### 3. CLV Components
- **AOV (Average Order Value)** = Revenue Ã· Order Count  
- **Purchase Frequency** = Orders Ã· Lifespan (per month)  
- **CLV per User** = AOV Ã— Purchase Frequency Ã— Lifespan  

### 4. Aggregation by Gender
- Rolled up user-level CLV to **gender segments**:
  - **Total Customers**  
  - **Total Revenue**  
  - **Average Revenue per Customer**  
  - **Average Orders per Customer**  
  - **Average CLV per Customer**  
  - **Total CLV (sum of individuals)**  

---

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated
- **Multi-table joins** across orders, items, and users.  
- **Customer-level aggregation** before segmentation.  
- **CLV calculation formula** (AOV Ã— Frequency Ã— Lifespan).  
- **Segmentation** at the gender level.  
- **Aggregated KPIs**: both total and average metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Gender | Customers | Gender Revenue | Avg Revenue per Customer | Avg Orders per Customer | Avg CLV per Customer | Total CLV |
|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Female | 3,148     | \$283,123      | \$89.94                  | 1.13                     | 18.4                 | 58,059.6  |
| Male   | 3,028     | \$319,249      | \$105.43                 | 1.13                     | 21.9                 | 66,426.2  |

## ðŸ”— Insights
- **Revenue Gap**: Male customers contribute **more total revenue** (~\$36k higher) despite a slightly smaller customer base.  
- **Higher Value per Customer**: Males average **\$105 per customer** vs. females at **\$90**.
- **Consistent Order Frequency**: Both genders average ~1.13 orders per customer, so higher male revenue is driven by **larger order sizes (AOV)**.  
- **CLV Difference**: Average CLV is **~19% higher for males** (21.9 vs. 18.4).  
- **Strategic Takeaway**:
  - Marketing and retention campaigns may yield greater ROI when targeted at **male customers**, though females represent a **slightly larger base (120 more customers)** and should remain part of acquisition strategies.
